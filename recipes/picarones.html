    <h1>Picarones (Chilean Pumpkin Doughnuts)</h1>
    <img src="/img/picarones.png" alt="picarones">
    <p>Picarones are a traditional Chilean dessert made from a soft dough that combines pumpkin or sweet potato with flour and yeast, creating a light and airy texture. These doughnuts are deep-fried until golden and crispy on the outside while remaining soft inside. They are then drizzled with a sweet syrup made from chancaca (raw cane sugar), cinnamon, cloves, and orange peel, adding a rich caramel-like flavor with warm, spiced notes. Their unique taste and texture make them a favorite treat, especially in autumn and winter.</p>
    <p>Originally inspired by Spanish buñuelos, picarones have become a beloved part of Chilean cuisine and are commonly enjoyed during national celebrations, fairs, and family gatherings. They are often served as a comforting street food, perfect for pairing with a cup of tea or coffee. With their crispy exterior, fluffy center, and delicious syrup, picarones offer a delightful combination of flavors that make them an irresistible dessert.</p>
