    <h2>Steps to Prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce - In a pan, sauté chopped onions and garlic in olive oil. Add ground beef (or a vegetarian alternative) and cook until browned. Pour in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, and season with salt, pepper, oregano, and basil. Let it simmer for 20–30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook the Pasta - Boil lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside. (Skip this step if using no-boil noodles.)</li>
        <li>Make the Béchamel (Optional) - In a saucepan, melt butter, add flour, and stir for a minute. Gradually pour in milk, whisking continuously until the sauce thickens. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna - In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of sauce at the bottom. Add a layer of lasagna noodles, followed by sauce, béchamel (if using), and grated cheese (like mozzarella and Parmesan). Repeat the layers until the dish is full, finishing with a generous amount of cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Bake - Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F) and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly. Let it rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy - Cut into portions and enjoy your homemade lasagna with a side of salad or garlic bread!</li>
