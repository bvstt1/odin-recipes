    <h1>Completo (Chilean Hot Dog)</h1>
    <img src="/img/completos.png" alt="completo">
    <p>The Completo is a beloved Chilean-style hot dog, known for its generous and flavorful toppings. Unlike a traditional hot dog, the Completo is served in a soft bun with a boiled or grilled sausage and topped with mashed avocado, chopped tomatoes, and a heavy drizzle of mayonnaise. Some variations include additional ingredients like sauerkraut, green chili sauce, or melted cheese. The most famous version, the Completo Italiano, is named after the colors of the Italian flag—green (avocado), white (mayonnaise), and red (tomato).</p>
    <p>This street food is a staple in Chilean cuisine, commonly enjoyed at food stands, fast-food restaurants, and family gatherings. It is often accompanied by crispy French fries and a cold drink. The Completo is not just a snack but a cultural icon, offering a delicious and satisfying bite with a perfect balance of creamy, tangy, and savory flavors.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hot dog buns</li>
        <li>4 sausages (frankfurters)</li>
        <li>1 ripe avocado</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tomato, finely chopped</li>

        <li>Mustard and ketchup (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to Prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Sausages - Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the sausages. Let them simmer for about 5 minutes until heated through. Alternatively, grill or pan-fry them for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Avocado Mixture - Mash the avocado in a bowl and mix it with salt and lemon juice to prevent browning.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Completo - Slice the buns open without cutting them completely. Place a sausage inside each bun.</li>
        <li>Add the Toppings - Spread mashed avocado over the sausage, then add chopped tomato. Drizzle mayonnaise on top (a generous amount is key!). Add mustard or ketchup if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy - Enjoy your Completo with a side of crispy fries or a refreshing so</li>
